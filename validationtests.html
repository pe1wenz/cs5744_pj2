      <h3>Validation Tests for SchedRunner</h3>

      <h4>1. Purpose</h4>
      <p>The validation tests are designed to confirm that the SchedRunner system aligns with the specified functional, performance, and internal design requirements. These tests ensure the complete system meets its end-to-end workflow requirements as outlined in the project scope. This section includes the creation of a traceability matrix to map test cases to system requirements, providing a systematic approach to verifying compliance.</p>

      <h4>2. Validation Test Plan</h4>
      <h5>2.1 Test Objectives</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Validate that all functional requirements (FRs) are met, including job configuration, dependency management, scheduling, and real-time monitoring.</li>
        <li>Ensure the system satisfies non-functional requirements (NFRs) such as performance under load, scalability, security, and fault tolerance.</li>
        <li>Confirm system integrity through comprehensive logging and secure communication.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>2.2 Test Environment</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>A simulated database for test jobs and dependencies.</li>
        <li>Mock systems for worker nodes and target machines to replicate real-world conditions.</li>
        <li>Performance monitoring tools to measure response times, scalability, and fault tolerance.</li>
        <li>API testing tools for validating secure interactions and CRUD operations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>2.3 Software Tools</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Traceability Tool: Maps test cases to system requirements.</li>
        <li>Simulation Frameworks: Dependency simulators and mock APIs.</li>
        <li>Load Testing Tools: Simulate high job volumes and monitor performance.</li>
        <li>Monitoring Dashboard: Validate real-time updates and user interactions.</li>
        <li>Error Injection Tools: Test system responses to faults and failures.</li>
      </ul>

        </li>
      </ul>

      <h5>3.4 End-to-End Validation</h5>

          <ul>
            <li>Create a job with dependencies and scheduling requirements.</li>
            <li>Monitor the job's execution across target machines.</li>
            <li>Verify the final state and ensure logs capture the full lifecycle of the job.</li>

        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>4. Results Evaluation</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pass Criteria:</strong> The test meets all functional and non-functional requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Fail Criteria:</strong> The test fails to meet one or more requirements, requiring re-evaluation of the system design or implementation.</li>
      </ul>
